# Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Reorganized GraphQL Operations**

   - Created a centralized `/src/graphql/operations` directory
   - Organized operations by domain (user, repository, project, etc.)
   - Ensured all GraphQL operations follow consistent naming and formatting

2. **Updated Services to Use Generated Types**

   - Modified UserService to use auto-generated GraphQL types
   - Updated RepositoryService for consistent error handling
   - Created helper methods for data transformation

3. **Created UserStore for State Management**

   - Created a proper MobX store for user data
   - Aligned with the pattern used by other stores
   - Made components use the store directly instead of the service

4. **Updated GraphQL Code Generation**

   - Configured codegen to prioritize the new operations folder
   - Ensured all operations are properly typed

5. **Updated Documentation**
   - Provided clear guidelines in GraphQL README
   - Documented best practices for working with GraphQL
   - Added helpful comments to GraphQL operation files

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Improve Type Usage**

   - Continue replacing custom types with generated types
   - Update `src/types/index.ts` to use types from GraphQL schema
   - Use proper type inheritance where appropriate

2. **Complete Service Refactoring**

   - Refactor ProjectService to use the same patterns as UserService
   - Update IssueService, ColumnService, and other services
   - Ensure consistent error handling across all services

3. **Complete Store Refactoring**

   - Ensure all stores use services in a consistent way
   - Add proper loading and error states to all stores
   - Make sure stores expose the right data to components

4. **Improve Testing**

   - Add tests for the refactored services
   - Create mock responses for GraphQL operations
   - Test error handling and edge cases

5. **Clean Up Legacy Code**
   - Remove unused code and old patterns
   - Consolidate duplicate functionality
   - Ensure all components use the new patterns

## Guidelines for Ongoing Development

1. **GraphQL Operations**

   - Add new operations to `/src/graphql/operations/{domain}/`
   - Follow the naming pattern for consistency
   - Document each operation with a comment describing its purpose
   - Add the operation name to `/src/constants/operations.ts`

2. **Services**

   - Add new methods to the appropriate service class
   - Transform GraphQL responses to application models
   - Handle errors consistently
   - Keep services focused on specific domains

3. **Stores**

   - Keep stores focused on specific state management
   - Use services for data fetching
   - Provide consistent loading and error states
   - Use MobX patterns for reactivity

4. **Components**
   - Make components observe stores, not call services directly
   - Keep components focused on presentation
   - Handle loading and error states consistently
   - Avoid duplicating business logic

By following these guidelines, the codebase will become more maintainable, type-safe, and easier to extend with new features.
